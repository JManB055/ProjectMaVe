            <p>This application (“the App”) was created as part of a university course project. It is not a commercial product and is used only for educational purposes. The App allows users to track gym workouts and optionally connect their Fitbit account to view activity data.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="mb-6">
            <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
            <p>We collect the following information when you use the App:</p>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside">
                <li>Name and email address (for login or account identification)</li>
                <li>Workout data such as exercise names, sets, reps, and weights lifted</li>
                <li>Fitbit data (such as activity summaries) if you connect your Fitbit account. This data is accessed only with your permission through the Fitbit API.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We do not collect or store body weight, heart rate, or any other biometric or medical data.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="mb-6">
            <h2>2. How We Use the Information</h2>
            <p>Your information is used solely to:</p>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside">
                <li>Display your workouts and progress within the App</li>
                <li>Associate your saved data with your account</li>
                <li>Provide Fitbit integration and allow you to view your synced data</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We do not sell, rent, or share any personal information with third parties.</p>
            <p>Additionally, the App may use your past workout data to generate future workout recommendations using artificial intelligence (AI) tools.</p>
            <p>When you request a new workout plan, your exercise history may be processed by an AI model to suggest exercises, sets, or weights that align with your goals.</p>
            <p>To provide these recommendations, limited workout data (such as exercise type and performance metrics) may be temporarily sent to a third-party AI service. No personal identifiers (such as name or email) or Fitbit data are included in these requests.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="mb-6">
            <h2>3. Data Retention and Deletion</h2>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside">
                <li>Your name, email, and workout data are stored securely in our project database for educational use.</li>
                <li>You may request deletion of your data or disconnection from Fitbit at any time.</li>
                <li>All data will be deleted when the course project concludes.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section class="mb-6">
            <h2>4. Security</h2>
            <p>We take reasonable steps to protect stored information, including password protection and limited access to the database.</p>
            <p>However, since this is a student project, it should not be considered production-grade or used for real-world fitness tracking.</p>
            <p>When AI services are used, only minimal and non-identifiable data is transmitted. We take steps to ensure that no personally identifiable or Fitbit-linked data is shared with external AI providers.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="mb-6">
            <h2>5. Legal Compliance</h2>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside">
                <li>This App is not a medical or diagnostic tool and is not subject to HIPAA.</li>
                <li>We follow the principles of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), including your rights to access, correct, and delete your data.</li>
                <li>Users have the right to request that their data not be used for automated analysis or AI-generated workout planning.</li>
                <li>This App complies with the Fitbit Developer Terms of Service and Fitbit Data Access Policy.</li>
